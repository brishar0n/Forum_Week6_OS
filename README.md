# Multi-Threaded Number Producer and Customer Program

This Python program demonstrates multi-threading and synchronization in a scenario where a producer thread generates random integers and inserts them into a bounded buffer, and two customer threads retrieves these numbers based on their parity (even or odd).

## Files:

- `main.py`: Python source code file containing the program implementation.
- `all.txt`: Output file containing all generated numbers.
- `even.txt`: Output file containing even numbers removed by the customer thread.
- `odd.txt`: Output file containing odd numbers removed by the customer thread.
